**OBJECTIVE**: Make Windows 11 Private!

# Steps:

**1.** Open 'Settings' < 'Privacy & security' < 'Windows permissions' < 'General' and turn the followings off:
  
  _(a)_ `Let apps show me personalized ads by using my advertising ID`
  
  _(b)_ `Let websites show me locally relevant content by accessing my language list`
  
  _(c)_ `Let Windows improve Start and search results by tracking app launches`
  
  _(d)_ `Show me suggested content in the Settings app`
  
 **2.** Go to 'Sppech' and turn off `Online speech recognition`
 
 **3.**  Go to 'Inking & typing personalization' and turn off `Personal inking and typing dictionary`
 
 **4.**  Go to 'Diagnostics & feedback' and do the following:
  
  _(a)_ Under 'Diagnostic data', turn off `Send optional diagnostic data`
  
  _(b)_ Turn off 'Improve inking and typing'
  
  _(c)_ Turn off 'Tailored experiences'.
  
  _(d)_ Under 'Delete diagnostic data', click `Delete`.

**5.** Under 'Activity history', uncheck `Store my activity history on this device` and under 'Clear activity history', click on `Clear`.

**6.** Navigate to 'App permissions'.

**7.** Go through 'Location, Camera, Microphone, Voice activation, Notifications, Account info, Contacts, Calendar, Phone calls, Call history, Email, Tasks, Messaging, Radios, Other devices, App diagnostics, Automatic file downloads, Documents, Downloads folder, Pictures, Videos, File system, Screenshot borders, and Screenshots and apps', and:
  
  (i) Select which apps to have access to which permissions and turn off unnecessary app permissions (**Recommended**). 
  
  Examples: Maps (Location), Camera (Camera), Voice Recorder (Microphone), etc.
  
  (ii) Or turn off permissions for all of these app permissions (**Not Recommended**).
  
Doing all of these will make your Windows 11 as private as possible.

# Other Important Implementations

   **1.** Use a password/PIN to sign in.

   _**How**: Settings < Accounts < Sign-in options < Ways to sign in < PIN (Windows Hello)_ 

   **2.** Use a Local Account, instead of a Microsoft Account.

   _**How**: Settings < Accounts < Other users < Add account
   When the sign-up prompt pops out, select `I don’t have this person’s sign-in information`. Then click on `Add a user without a Microsoft account` and click on `Next`. Then, fill up the username and password and answer the security questions, and finally click on `Next`. The local account will be created successfully._

   **3.** Don't use Cortana.
   
   # Other Methods

   # Is It Possible?

   Well, Windows 11 is really secure, but it's not private. Even if you implement all these settings, Microsoft will still collect some personal data (of course, less after
   implementing these settings).

# Thanks!

Thank you for having a look here!
